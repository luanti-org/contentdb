## Development

ContentDB was created by [rubenwardy](https://rubenwardy.com/) in 2018, he was lucky enough to have the time available
as it was submitted as university coursework. To learn about the history and development of ContentDB,
[see the blog post](https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2022/03/24/contentdb/).

ContentDB is open source software, licensed under AGPLv3.0.

## Why was ContentDB created?

Before ContentDB, users had to manually install mods and games by unzipping their files into a directory. This is
poor user experience, especially for first-time users.

ContentDB isn't just about supporting the in-game content downloader; it's common for technical users to find
and review packages using the ContentDB website, but install using Git rather than the in-game installer.
**ContentDB's purpose is to be a well-formatted source of information about mods, games,
and texture packs for Luanti**.

## How do I learn how to make mods and games for Luanti?

You should read
[the official Luanti Modding Book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/)
for a guide to making mods and games using Luanti.
